# A Guide to Using Docker, for Vachan-api V2

## Setup docker

prefered versions: 24.0.1

If usng the above version docker compose is included within docker. But for previous versions it needs to be installed separately.

For docker installation, if required
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

On local system, if you prefer to install docker desktop
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/

To remove sudo need
```
> sudo groupadd docker
> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
> newgrp docker
> docker run hello-world #(to test)
```

## Clone the right branch and repo

If you are setting up the vachan-api repo for the first time, clone the specific branch with the following command.

```git clone -b version-2 https://github.com/Bridgeconn/vachan-api.git```

If you have already set up the repo and remotes for development, pull latest code from [upstream/version-2](https://github.com/Bridgeconn/vachan-api/tree/version-2).


```cd vachan-api/docker```


## To start app locally

VACHAN_SUPER_USERNAME, VACHAN_SUPER_PASSWORD are the minimum required environment variables. This can either be set in the `~/.bashrc` file or save in a local `.env` file and passed via command line.
```
  export VACHAN_SUPER_USERNAME="<super-admin-email-id>"
  export VACHAN_SUPER_PASSWORD="<a-strong-password>"
```
The username should be your email id and password must be a strong password.

If you just want to setup and start app locally, from the vachan-api/docker folder, do

```docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --profile local-run up```
 
or

```docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --env-file=path/to/file.env --profile local-run up```

If all goes well you should be able to get proper outputs at `http://localhost`, `http://localhost/docs`,
`http://localhost/v2/cms/rest/docs`,`http://localhost/v2/text/translate/token-based/docs`,`http://localhost/v2/auth/docs`,`http://localhost//v2/ai/docs`,`http://localhost/v2/graphql`,`http://localhost/v2/demos`,`http://127.0.0.1:4434/identities`  and connect to postgresDB at `localhost`, `5433`

(Error reports from Kratos container related to failed email sending can be ignored as long as above URLs are accessible).

To turn the app down, use

```docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --profile local-run down```


<!-- ## To run tests

This method is recommended to just run all the tests once to make sure everything works, like in production, CI/CD or locally when verifying a PR. While doing local development and when we may have to run tests selectively and multiple times, after code changes, use the method specificed in [readme](../README.md#set-up-locally-for-development-and-testingwithout-docker).

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml up # to start the dependancies
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml run vachan-api-test --build
```

To turn down the running containers after test has been exited,

```docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml down``` -->

## To deploy on server
Install docker, docker-compose & git and set up the right repo and branch. 

Back in the vachan-api server,along with VACHAN_SUPER_USERNAME and VACHAN_SUPER_PASSWORD, need to set VACHAN_AUTH_DATABASE, VACHAN_SUPPORT_EMAIL_CREDS and VACHAN_SUPPORT_EMAIL as environment variables along with other required values, in the `prod.env` file.

Refer the following format
```
VACHAN_SUPER_USERNAME="<super-admin-emial-id>"
VACHAN_SUPER_PASSWORD="<a-strong-password>"
VACHAN_AUTH_DATABASE="postgresql://<DB-user>:<DB-passwords>@kratos-postgresd:<DB-port>/<DB-name>"
VACHAN_SUPPORT_EMAIL_CREDS="smtps://<email-id>:<password>:<email-service>:<smtp-port>/?skip_ssl_verify=true&legacy_ssl=true"
VACHAN_SUPPORT_EMAIL="<email-id>"
VACHAN_DOMAIN=api.vachanengine.org
VACHAN_KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL="http://api.vachanengine.org:4433/"
VACHAN_KRATOS_ADMIN_URL="http://api.vachanengine.org:4434/"
VACHAN_POSTGRES_PASSWORD="<a-strong-password>"
VACHAN_KRATOS_DB_USER="<vachan_auth_user>"
VACHAN_KRATOS_DB_PASSWORD="<a-strong-password>"
VACHAN_KRATOS_DB_NAME="<vachan_auth_db>"
VACHAN_GITLAB_TOKEN="<api-token-from-gitlab>"
VACHAN_REDIS_PASS="<a-strong-password>"
VACHAN_AI_DELETION_PERIOD=<no_of_days>
VACHAN_AI_CRON_DAY=<no_of_days>
VACHAN_AI_CRON_HOUR=<hour>
VACHAN_AI_CRON_MINUTE=<minute>
VACHAN_AI_DATA_PATH=<ai_data_path>
```
Once the ENV file is ready, pass it to CLI and start the services as below:

For Staging:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --env-file=prod.env --profile deployment up --build --force-recreate -d
```

For Production:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml --env-file=prod.env --profile deployment up --build --force-recreate -d
```

To re-create SSL certificates, follow instructions [here](https://mindsers.blog/post/https-using-nginx-certbot-docker/)

For Staging:

```
docker compose  -f docker-compose-staging.yml --profile deployment run --rm certbot renew
```

For Production:

```
docker compose  -f docker-compose-production.yml --profile deployment run --rm certbot renew
```

After this make sure the certificate folder in the app root has access permission. or change it with `sudo chmod -R 777 certbot/`. Then the App needs to be restarted as shown below to use the updated ceritifcate.

### To start the app

```
cd ~/vachan-api/docker
```
For Staging: 
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --env-file=prod.env --profile deployment up --build --force-recreate -d
```

For Production: 
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml --env-file=prod.env --profile deployment up --build --force-recreate -d
```

## To Down the App

For Staging:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --profile deployment --env-file prod.env down
```

For Production:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml --profile deployment --env-file prod.env down
```


### To re-deploy on server

After git pull, running the same command above, will re-build and re-start the containers.
```ssh user@server_address```

```
cd ~/vachan-api
git pull origin <branch or tag>
cd docker
```

For Staging: 

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml --env-file=prod.env --profile deployment up --build --force-recreate -d
```

For Production: 

```
docker compose -f docker-compose-production.yml --env-file=prod.env --profile deployment up --build --force-recreate -d
```


To start with a fresh DB, stop and remove containers and remove volume `vachan-db-vol`.
To clear all old logs, similarly remove the volume `logs-vol`.
To clear all user data, remove the volume `kratos-postgres-vol`, on local or on the central server.

Some useful commands for the above tasks
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml down

docker ps # list all running containers
docker ps -a # list all running and stopped containers
docker kill <id> # stop a specific docker container
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) # removes all running and stopped docker images 

docker volume rm vachan-db-vol
```

For inspecting logs, DB etc check the corresponding docker volumes
```
docker volume list
docker volume inspect vachan-db-vol
sudo -i # to become root user to be able to cd into the voulume directory
cd path/to/docker/volume
ls
...
exit # to switch back to normal user
```

## For Development

To run the app and tests locally during development, you need to have only the Kratos docker containers running locally to facilitate authentication. Virtual environment, Database, usfm-grammar, environment variables etc should be set up seperatly locally. Follow the instructions in [readme](../README.md#set-up-locally-for-development-and-testingwithout-docker) for that.


## Frequently Encountered Issues

1. Compatibility issues with docker-compose version
> To be able to support the docker-copmose files used by us and by Kratos it is strongly recommended you upgrade to a docker-compose version >= 1.29. Instructions are [here](#)

2. Port 5432(or some other) already in use.
> This error occurs because there is a port mapping given in the docker-compose file(quick-start.yml, run-tests.yml, run-test-denpendecies.yml, production-deploy.yml etc) in the format 
```
    ports:
      # <host>:<container>
      - "5432:5432"
```
 and the port `5432` in the host machine is already being used by some other app(eg: local postgres service). You can change the mapped port to an unused value to fix this error
 ```
     ports:
      # <host>:<container>
      - "5435:5432"
```

3. Error related to `sources` table not found upon app start up is due to DB connection or DB initialization issues

4. Error related to super user not created or not found might be related to un successfull setting up of Kratos containers or DB connection

5. To remove users in Kratos
> While developing on local system, if you are running Kratos with quickstart.yml, stop the execution with `ctrl+c` and also do `docker-compose -f quickstart.yml down`. Then, after getting message on terminal that all containers have been removed(not just stopped), restart Kratos with `docker-compose -f quickstart.yml up`
